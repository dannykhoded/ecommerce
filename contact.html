        <p>That spirit can do many things and nothing is impossible for him but what he will not attend to are many 
        because we lost its way to communicate.
        <span class="bag"> Don't just think you can boss him around only when you need him,</span> he won't attend
         to it ,he is not human.
        Neither a creature of any world but an abstract spirit that we don't know maybe he is listening to our request.
        Those of the ancient<span class="a">communicate</span> with him not only when they need him but daily unlike we of this modern 
        world we only communicate when we need him to accomplish a mission
          Am telling you he won't hear and that's not stop him been GOD because he will always bless those he wish to
        bless no matter the<span class="a"> circumstances</span> Brethren Call him daily he is near Call him when the soul is still in this 
        body because when the soul leave the body, judgment is the next step...
        Good morning </p>
